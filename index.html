			<p class="intro"> What is Congenital Heart Disease? </p>

			<p>Congenital heart disease (CHD) refers to a group of cardiac conditions
			that manifest at birth. Based on the appearance of the blood arteries and 
			the heart, there are numerous forms of CHD with varying degrees of severity. 
			The heart chambers could be missing or deformed, which could lead to problems 
			with breathing and even thinking. </p>

					<p>Approximately every year 40,000 babies are born with CHD
						 in the United States. They are born with different kinds
						  of heart issues and the need of a heart surgery to have a 
						  better health condition. As The Children’s Heart Foundation 
						  stated, “Even with improved treatments, people with CHDs are
						   not cured even if their heart defect has been repaired. 
						   People with a CHD can develop other health problems over time, 
						   depending on their specific heart defect, the number of heart defects 
						   they have, and the severity of their heart defect.”
